Chronograf will follow a freemium model. It’ll be free to use in an unlimited fashion for a single user. If you want to enable features around multiple users, teams, and security, it’ll be licensed per user, per year. However, the initial releases for the next few months will be completely free to use as we build up the feature set and improve things.
